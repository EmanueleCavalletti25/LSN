## How to use my code - LSN Exercise 01

## Compile and execute programm:

### Exercise 1.1

For the  compilation of the exercise  Go into `Lezione_1/Esercizio_1_1` and
- to compile hit `make`
- to remove `*.o` and `*.exe` files, hit `make clean`
- finally to execute the simulation, hit `./main.exe` , where are request also <Number_Of_Random_Numbers> <Number_of_Blocks>

### Exercise 1.2

For the  compilation of the exercise  Go into `Lezione_1/Esercizio_1_2` and
- to compile hit `make`
- to remove `*.o` and `*.exe` files, hit `make clean`
- finally to execute the simulation, hit `./main.exe` , where are request also <Number_Of_Random_Numbers>
